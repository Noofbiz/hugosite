Hello, my name is Jerry Caligiure. Welcome to my blog!

Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, I'm now juggling homeschooling my 3rd
grader on top of entertaining the 4 year old. To say it's hectic is putting it
lightly. Despite all these challenges, I'm still finding time to lightly work on
some other projects.

I am a father, husband, software developer, and science and math enthusiast
Those are the subjects this blog will most likely cover.

I'm currently working on Roblox game called
[Rogue Science](https://www.roblox.com/groups/7640052/Rogue-Scientists#!/about).
I'm doing the game design, scripting, and modeling for it. It should be ready by
the start of 2021 for alpha-testing, if anyone is interested!

Down the road, I've got a project called
[Let's Save Summer](https://www.letssavesummer.com). It's a coming-of-age RPG
about a group of friends on their summer break! The game is going to be
intensely episodic, about 15 minutes of play time per chapter. This is to make
it influenced by the player's decisions in ways never before possible. Based on
the player's actions in the game, the entire story could unfold differently!
The game will be available in the browser or available to subscribers to my
Patreon as a native desktop download. The game will be made using the
[engo](https://engoengine.github.io) game engine, which is an ecs game engine I
help design and maintain.

Make sure to check out more of my projects in the [Showcase](/showcase)!
