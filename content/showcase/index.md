Welcome to a showcase of projects I worked on / am working on!

# [engo](https://engoengine.github.io)

`engo` is a 2-D ecs game engine written in the go programming language. I manage
the day-to-day of the project, keep up on the Continuous Integration to ensure
the engine builds at each PR, review the PR to ensure it meets quality standards
and guidelines, and map out the future of the project and which features will
be added/maintained. Currently I'm working on adding gamepad support on all
supported platforms as well as migrating the renderer from GL to
more modern drivers, such as Vulkan, Metal and DirectX.

# [Let's Save Summer!](https://www.letssavesummer.com)

Let's Save Summer is a webcomic video-game hybrid using the `engo` game engine.
SNES-JRPG inspired game that uses a unique real-time combat system.

# [hypnic](https://github.com/Noofbiz/hypnic)

A game made for the 2018 Open Game Art Game Jam. Uses android-build to utilize
accelerometers on android, and you can control your guy that way. Made in `engo`.

# [Feed Me!](https://github.com/Noofbiz/FeedMe)

A desktop GUI RSS feed reader. It uses a SQL database to keep your feed data,
and utilizes the MVC framework to separate tasks in a convenient way. The front
end uses electron via go-astrillectron bindings, and the back-end is just a
standard library server connected to a SQL database.

# [gleam](https://github.com/Noofbiz/gleam)

Cross platform window system. Inspired by GLFW and Shiny, it's a pure-go window
system that allows you to control size, position, and draw to the window.
Currently only supports OSX, and it's really just a hobby to cut my teeth on
Cgo. Might be worked on more when I have more free time.

# [Rogue Science](https://www.roblox.com/groups/7640052/Rogue-Scientists#!/about)

A Roblox game. I'm doing the scripting (in Lua), as well as the modeling.
Mostly just a fun hobby to occupy a couple months before and after I recover
from my upcoming surgery.

# [Du Valiant Feu Beaucerons](https://github.com/Noofbiz/duvaillantfeu)

A website for a friend's Beauceron breeding business. Uses a basic MVC framework
and go's native http server. Front-end is Bootstrap 3 and jquery. Is able to
send/submit applications by sending an email server-side.

# [Mixie Melts](https://github.com/Noofbiz/mixiemelts)

A website for an e-commerce business. Uses just in time inventory to keep stock
up to date with sales. Connects to PayPal to accept many major payment methods.
Uses cookies to keep a shopping cart.
