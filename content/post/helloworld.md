Hello everyone!

<!--more-->

This is really just and introductory post. So, let's get to it! Hello there!
I'm Jerry. I live in Youngstown, Ohio, US with my wife and two sons. My interests
include programming (currently using a lot of Go, but I dabble about the place),
physics, working on FPGA boards and other small digital electronic devices
(raspberry pi, arduino), and playing games with the family.

Not sure what else to say right now. Maybe I'll think of more later?

Until then,
