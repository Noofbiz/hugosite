I'm going to participate in the
[Github Game-Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020) this year! But with some
interesting aspects, to make it more fun! This time, I'm going to build the
whole game in Go!

But Jerry! You already maintain a pretty awesome game engine in go! Why don't
you just use that!

You misunderstand! I'm going to make EVERYTHING in go. Of course, engo will be
there! But I'm going to create all the textures using
[gg](https://github.com/fogleman/gg), programatically! I'm also going
to create all the sound effects (and possibly music depending on how good I
get at it) using [GoAudio](https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio)! I'm going to
open-source the project, so people can see that everything is made in Go!
I also plan on updating this blog with progress and things I learn along the way!

Wish me luck!
